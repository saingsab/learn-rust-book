/*
Methods are similar to functions: we declare them with the fn keyword and a name, 
they can have parameters and a return value, 
and they contain some code thatâ€™s run when the method is called from somewhere else. 
Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, 
which we cover in Chapter 6 and Chapter 17, respectively), and their first parameter is always self, 
which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
